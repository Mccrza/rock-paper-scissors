# rock-paper-scissors

The Odin Project - Javascript Fundamentals Course - Project: Rock Paper Scissors

The title says it all... will be my first Javascript project; a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors played against the computer.

I'll be starting off with a function call, `getComputerChoice`, that will randomly return either `Rock` `Paper` or `Scissors`, and make the computer play. For a single round of Rock Paper Scissors I'll be using a function which takes two parameters - `playerSelection` and `computerSelection` - then returns a string which declares the winner of the round: `"You Lose! Paper beats Rock."`

Next will be the `playRound` function called inside of another function, `game()`, and will keep score and report a winner or loser at the end of the rounds.

Loops will be made utilized to though the rounds, and `prompt()` used to get input from the user, and any additional functions as they may be needed!
