The Odin Project - Javascript Fundamentals Course - Project: Rock Paper Scissors

First JavaScript project, creating a versus-Computer game
of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

Function `getComputerChoice()` selects the computer's move, while `getPlayerChoice()` prompts the user for input on theirs. Calling the function `game()` takes the arguments `computerSelection` and `playerSelection` from the previously explained functions and sets them to round
compared with `if...else if` statements on a `for..loop` for five rounds. Score is tallied each round and a winner
is declared at the conclusion. I've made a simple HTML page using basic CSS which calls the `game()` function from user input (`onclick`).
